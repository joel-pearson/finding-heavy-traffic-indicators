Dataquest project04: finding heavy traffic indicators on I-94

---

The goal of our analysis is to determine a few indicators of heavy traffic on I-94. These indicators can be weather type, time of the day, time of the week, etc. For instance, we may find out that the traffic is usually heavier in the summer or when it snows.

The main focus of this work is to develop my own understanding of data science and apply what I have learnt so far (on dataquest) to a realistic data analysis application.
